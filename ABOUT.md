c or arduino function to control one input and output (IO Pins) the input pin is a switch as interrupt once it pressed it should lighting the led connected to output pin.
if the switch pressed must send “pressed” to the serial monitor only one time also send the LED states ”ON” or “OFF”
the whole function could be used many times in the program without interfering each-other
my program can send continuous serial date comes from temperature sensor with 3 second rate .at the same time
